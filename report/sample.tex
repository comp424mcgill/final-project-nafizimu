\section{Introduction}

Our agent is a Python module named \texttt{student\_agent.py} that consists of classes called \texttt{MCTSNode} and \texttt{StudentAgent}.

\subsection{\texttt{StudentAgent}}

\texttt{StudentAgent} is the entry point of the module for the \textit{Colosseum Survival!} game.
It consists of the \texttt{\_\_init\_\_} method to construct the agent, helper functions, global variables, and a \texttt{step} method.

\texttt{\_\_init\_\_} initializes variables including \texttt{self.is\_first\_round} which is \texttt{True} if the current turn is the first turn.

The \texttt{step} method is one of the public interface for the \textit{Colosseum Survival!} game to make a decision for a single turn.
The method sets \texttt{StudentAgent.end\_time} to the time when the MCTS should stop searching, calls \texttt{StudentAgent.mcts}, and then returns the most optimal next position and direction discovered.

The \texttt{StudentAgent.bfs} is a static method that performs Breadth-First Search.
It returns a generator that returns a sequence of \texttt{(number of steps, point)} where the points are legally accessible from the starting point within the maximum step.
If given the adversary's position, it will not visit the adversary's position.
This function is used to find all the legally accessible points for the player at the starting point.

The \texttt{StudentAgent.greedy\_search} method is a static method that performs a greedy search.
It is greedy because it uses min-heap to prioritize points that are closest to the adversary's point in terms of Manhattan distance.
It also cannot pass through walls, but it ignores the maximum step.
This function serves two purpose: to determine whether both players are on the same region, or to return all the points that are within the same region as the starting point.
The purpose of making the function greedy is to stop calculating the score of a chessboard as soon as it is discovered that both players are still in the same region.

The \texttt{StudentAgent.game\_score} method is a static method that calculates the score of the chessboard.
It returns a \texttt{tuple} where the first value is score of the first player, and the second value is the score of the second player;
otherwise it returns \texttt{None} if both players are on the same region.
The method uses \texttt{greedy\_search} to not only explore the region of the players and calculate their score, but also to determine if both players are on the same region much sooner.

The \texttt{StudentAgent.set\_wall} method is a static method to set the value of a wall in a chessboard.
The method serves two purpose: to conveniently set a wall at opposite sides, and to return \texttt{True} if the wall placed is connected to other walls on both ends of the wall.
The purpose of the latter is to reduce the number of calls to \texttt{StudentAgent.game\_score} in a Monte-Carlo method;
the assumption is that if both ends are not connected, then no new region is created, so the score would be the exact same as previous turn.

The \texttt{StudentAgent.mcts} method is a static method that performs Monte-Carlo Tree Search using \texttt{MCTSNode} until the time limit.
After the time limit is reached, it will return the most optimal next position and direction discovered.

\section{Report}

You are required to write a report with a detailed explanation of your approach and reasoning. The report must be a typed PDF file, and should be free of spelling and grammar errors. The suggested length is between 4 and 8 pages, but the most important constraint is that the report be clear and concise. You should use the source of this document \footnote{You can find the source of this document in Overleaf here: \href{https://www.overleaf.com/read/gcpfjdpqpytp}{https://www.overleaf.com/read/gcpfjdpqpytp}. You would need to create an Overleaf account. Copy this project and create a new project to write your report. Replace the \texttt{author} information with your own group information.} as a template to write your report in \LaTeX.  The report must include the following required components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An explanation of how your program works, and a motivation for your approach.
    \item A brief description of the theoretical basis of the approach (about a half-page in most cases); references to the text of other documents, such as the textbook, are appropriate but not absolutely necessary. If you use algorithms from other sources, briefly describe the algorithm and be sure to cite your source.
    \item A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of your approach, expected failure modes, or weaknesses of your program.
    \item If you tried other approaches during the course of the project, summarize them briefly and discuss how they compared to your final approach.
    \item A brief description (max. half page) of how you would go about improving your player (e.g. by introducing other AI techniques, changing internal representation etc.)
    
\end{itemize}
